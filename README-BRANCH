This is the 0.1.3.15 branch

(below is an example of how this number works)

The version numbers have signifigance and apply to ALL of my projects:

                                      THE 1 or 2 digit
                       ____________   RELEASE BRANCH
                     /                     MONTH
                    /
                   /
   
   0000    11    3333   111   55555
   0  0     1       3     1   5                        THE RELEASE
   0  0     1    3333     1   5555   <-----------------   BRANCH
   0  0     1       3     1       5                    2-DIGIT YEAR
   0000 .  111 . 3333 .  111  5555
   
    |       |
    |       |     
    |       |
    |       `-------- MINOR VERSION NUMBER [ 0 means alpha, >=1 regular version number minor (see notes) ]
    \
     \_____  MAJOR VERSION NUMBER [ 0 means beta, >=1 means release, 99 means final ]

NOTES

- So what does that mean, it means 0.1.3.15 = Beta Vesion 1, March of 2015.. easy huh?   
- regular version number minors are not build numbers (those are not shown in the branch number, but in the source itself, if applicable)
- build numbers are not used for script projects, only compiled source projects
- these rules are subject to change at any time, but I expect to use them indefinitely
